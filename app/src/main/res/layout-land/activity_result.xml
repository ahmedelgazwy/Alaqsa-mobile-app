Many countries have been affected by the lack of internal and external tourism.  The main debate among many countries has become about the importance and benefits of tourism and how it affects the economy and development.

All these types of tourism interest me a lot and I love to do them.

Of course, tourism has been greatly affected in the past two years as a result of the Corona virus outbreak. But it is good that they were able to sell some antiques through the Internet .

Tourism has been greatly affected in many countries, and many of these countries have greatly affected their economy and suffered due to a lack of tourism. The shortage of hard currency affects a lot in any country.

Such as islands and areas that are not rich in other sources of income. These areas are completely dependent on tourism.

There are also other countries, although there are other sources to attract tourism, such as agriculture or industry, but they are also affected because many trades arise as a result of the influx of some types of tourism, including commercial tourism. Therefore, tourism is very important for all countries and should be given a lot of attention.



A paragraph about tourism
Tourism is an important destination for many people who are interested in seeing different places than they live in or see beautiful landscapes that they have not been able to see before.

I live in a tourist country where many people come every year in the winter because of the snowfall and the freezing of lakes and rivers.

My country is famous for the thickness of the ice, which allows many ski enthusiasts to enjoy and experience some interesting adventures.

Skiing is the most important source of tourism for us and many come because of the high plateaus, which are famous for their toughness to challenge and climb.

Some local ski jumping competitions are also held, with many professional runners from different countries participating. This is because of its wide fame.

Therefore, I find it good for any country to benefit from its resources, even if they are as simple as snow. It is good to have such tourism, which benefits the economic income of the country and the individual.



Short Paragraph About Tourism
There is no doubt that the tourism sector is of great importance to all countries of the world. It represents an important factor for the advancement of the economy, which helps many countries in the development, construction, and social improvement of many individuals working in the tourism sector.

Foreign currencies of all countries represent a very important source. We often find that the most important source of currency availability is through tourism and the injection of currency into the markets to return these currencies for import and export and to facilitate transactions with other countries.

Therefore, it is available to everyone and can be traded easily without any rise in the currency in the event of a decrease in banks and exchange offices.

The value of any currency can be determined by its value in dollars at the present time. And the more sources of income for foreign currency are numerous, the higher the currency of this town and the greater its prosperity.

Therefore, tourism may play a major role in the environment that surrounds us, preserving it, and increasing the  strong infrastructure to serve this environment.

Paragraph about importance of tourism
Tourism plays an important and significant role in the economy of all countries. It represents an important external source of income for foreign currency, which makes it available and accessible in the markets and banks, facilitating foreign purchases through imports.

Tourism represents various opportunities internally and externally for all countries of the world. Benefiting from it is multiple, whether for government institutions, or for companies and individuals who profit by working in tourism.

Tourism varies according to the state’s resources. There are general tourism, medical tourism, commercial tourism, and agricultural tourism.

When paying attention to all kinds of these tourism and providing safety, amenities and easy infrastructure, a great and different attraction occurs, which helps any country to grow and progress, without relying on the natural resources in it, ensuring the prolongation of the life of any natural resource, and preserving it from expiry and loss in a short time .

What is meant by internal resources such as coal, gas, oil, petroleum, gold, precious stones. Whatever the amount of internal wealth, it is subject to expiration, so it is wonderful to provide other sources of income that help in the growth of the economy away from internal resources.



Write an essay on importance of tourism
We can say that tourism has been around for decades, but it has become more important in the past years. After some countries rich in natural resources studied the flow and how long it can continue, and discovered that their natural resources are subject to stopping and ending in the near future, so the plan was a complete and radical change in customs and traditions, and the development of future plans for the country.

Among these rich countries are Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia. It can be said that the UAE is one of the first countries that started working on increasing the country’s economic resources and developing future plans that dispense with dependence on oil and other natural resources. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia followed it. But Saudi Arabia remains the first study .

Therefore, in this century, we find that many countries are following plans to provide national income to the state through means different from its natural resources, work on infrastructure, and provide all requirements so that it can benefit from its other resources, including tourism. Which contains many benefits and resources, so it is possible to benefit from medical tourism, commercial tourism, and general tourism.

In all types of tourism, the state benefits from investment and the injection of foreign currencies into the market, which benefits it and the individuals."
